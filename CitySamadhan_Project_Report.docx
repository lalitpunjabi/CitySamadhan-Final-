## Project Report

---

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Introduction about Project

CitySamadhan is a comprehensive civic complaint management system designed to bridge the gap between citizens and municipal authorities. The system provides a digital platform where citizens can report urban issues such as potholes, street lighting problems, water supply issues, and other civic concerns directly to the relevant departments. Built using Python Flask framework, the system offers an intuitive web interface that allows users to submit complaints with detailed descriptions, location information, and supporting images. The platform also includes features for tracking complaint status, receiving notifications, and community voting to prioritize critical issues.

### 1.2 Need of Computerization of System

In today's digital era, manual processes for handling civic complaints are inefficient and time-consuming. Traditional methods of reporting issues through phone calls or physical visits to government offices often result in delayed responses and poor tracking mechanisms. The computerization of this system addresses several critical needs:

1. **Efficiency**: Digital processing eliminates paperwork and reduces response time
2. **Transparency**: Citizens can track their complaints in real-time
3. **Accountability**: Automated notifications ensure departments respond promptly
4. **Data Analytics**: Systematic data collection enables better urban planning
5. **Resource Optimization**: Proper categorization and routing of complaints improve resource allocation

### 1.3 Problem Definition

The primary problem addressed by CitySamadhan is the lack of an efficient, transparent, and accountable system for citizens to report civic issues. Key problems include:

- Delayed response times from municipal departments
- Lack of transparency in complaint resolution process
- Difficulty in tracking complaint status
- Inefficient allocation of resources to address civic issues
